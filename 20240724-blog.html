        <p>At this early stage, I'm still trying to get my basic blog up and running.</p>

        <p>I am already starting the feel the importance of having a really logical process to dev work, where I systematically work through tasks and 
            have some kind of structure to the way I work.</p>

        <p>I say this because I'm currently on my third attempt at having the core blog code ready, but so far rather than try to get the HTML sorted before 
            moving onto the CSS and design, I'm quickly switching between the two and therefore getting nowhere.</p>

        <p>One of the first things I learnt on my HTML and CSS fundamentals course was this: <strong>HTML for content; CSS for presentation</strong>. And I 
            have already made so much more progress by concentrating purely on the HTML first, and then looking at styling it once I'm happy I have everything 
            I want on the page.</p>

        <p>I hope and imagine that maybe when I'm more experienced and skilled/knowledgeable, then maybe I'll be able to do a bit of both and make some good 
            progress, but for now I definitely need to keep things simple.</p>
