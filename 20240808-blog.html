        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <h3><time datetime="2024-08-08">8 August 2024</time></h3>

        <p>In my first ever blog entry (which you almost certainly won't have read), I mentioned how I've tried 
          teaching myself to code a few times, but alway dropped out or burnt out after a few months, even though 
          I  enjoyed myself throughout. I've spent a few weeks reflecting on why this always seems to happen so I can 
          try and learn some useful lessons. I've had a few thoughts.</p>

        <p>Here are some of the mistakes I think I've made.</p>

        <h4>1. Not prioritising having fun</h4>

        <p>OK, so this might sound a twee one to start with. But something kept cropping up when I was 
          self-reflecting: my sole motivation for learning to code has always been to end up with a career in development.</p>

        <p>I see coding as a creative hobby, no different really to other creative pursuits like learning to 
          play an instrument or painting. How many people start learning to play the guitar with the sole aim of joining a band 
          and becoming a professional musician? I'm not talking about someone just dreaming - 'Wow, wouldn't it be great if I was 
          in a touring rock band' - I mean getting famous being the only reason they practise. That seems like a sure fire path to 
          burnout.</p>

        <p>I produce my own electronic music <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rquitmusic" target="_blank">under the name 
          <strong>rquit</strong></a>. I enjoy it. I'm not too bad at it. And funnily enough, I've also burnt myself out 
          on this numerous times too. Why? Well, my creative hobbies always tend to follow the same trajectory:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Start doing it for fun, and have loads of fun</li>
          <li>The thought crosses my mind, 'Imagine doing this for a living!'</li>
          <li>Immediately start trying to do it for a living</li>
          <li>Hold myself to professional standards</li>
          <li>Stop having fun</li>
          <li>Get disheartened and quit</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I'm sure there are some people who can have these lofty ambitions and priorities and also still have fun. But 
          I am not one of those people. So I need a different motivation, and I think I need some other targets that just, 'Try and 
          get a job in this, and anything less that this is failure'. If I can keep enjoying myself, keep learning, and maybe take 
          part in some community projects once I'm experienced enough, that's still time well spent.</p>

        <h4>2. Setting unrealistic goals</h4>

        <p>This one follows on quite nicely. The second I decide I want to start doing something to a professional 
          standard (which, I should state, is not a <em>bad thing</em> in and of itself), I draw up a silly, unrealistic study 
          schedule which immediately adds unnecessary self-imposed pressure: <em>'If I work really hard and study for only 4 hours a 
          day, I could probably get myself job-ready in six months.'</em></p>

        <p>This can cause burnout in a number of ways: it sucks the fun out of coding, because suddenly you're treating this thing 
          you started doing for fun like a second job, and you're setting yourself up for disappointment when you're still working your boring 
          office job after six months.</p>

        <p>As an example, here's the beginner roadmap for a Full Stack Developer, taken from the excellent 
          <a href="https://roadmap.sh/full-stack" target="_blank">roadmap.sh</a>:</p>

        <div class="centredDiv">
          <a href="/assets/full-stack-roadmap.JPG" target="_blank">
            <img src="/assets/full-stack-roadmap.JPG" alt="Picture showing the learning pathway for a Full Stack Developer">
          </a>
        </div>

        <p>The roadmap includes a number of languages, projects, concepts, etc. that all need to be learned. Now you 
          tell me - do you think that's only six month's worth of study?! I guess you could <em>try</em> and crank that out in 
          six months, but good luck to you.</p>

        <div class="smallPrint">
          <p>(As a brief aside, it's really worth really highlighting for beginners that you can't just learn one language and then do 
            everything you want with it. When I first tried learning C#, I held the misconception that this one language was all 
            I needed. I remember finishing my C# fundamentals course (big shout out to 
            <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bob+tabor+c%23&t=ffab&ia=web" target="_blank"> Bob Tabor</a>, you are <strong>the 
              man</strong>) and then thinking I must now be ready to build my first android app. I booted up Visual Studio and 
            was immediately hit by the realisation, <em>'Oh god I now have to learn a couple of other frameworks and markup 
            languages - I think it was Xamarin and XAML at the time - before I can make a start?!') </em></p>
        </div>

        <p>Other than just pure mental burnout, unrealistic goals around timescales are also dangerous because you can easily 
          fall into the trap of passively rushing through learning just so you can tick off having 'completed' that language or that 
          project. So you've got all this internal pressure on yourself, and then as you're studying away, you realise you've not 
          really understood the things you've been trying to learn anyway because you were rushing.</p>

        <h4>3. Being a passive learner</h4>

        <p>At least in my case, this mistake is a direct result of the first two mistakes.</p>

        <p>When you're determined to learn everything there is to learn in an unrealistically short space of time, you quickly 
          end up being a passive learner. This is where you read an article or follow a tutorial about a particular concept, 
          finish it and then think, 'OK cool, I know how that works now. On to the next topic.' You rush because you're 
          desperate to get onto the next topic.</p>

        <p>But it's when you become an <em>active learner</em> that you start to really understand topics. Reading the article, 
          following along with the examples provided, then writing your own code to play around with what you've 
          just learnt - that's how you build understanding. When you look at the example code and think, 'I wonder what would 
          happen if I changed this thing? I bet I could break it...' or, 'That's given me a really good idea for a project I 
          could build - I'll make a note of that and have a go once I've finished up this lesson.'</p>

        <p>Passive learners get stuck in tutorial hell because they need someone to tell them exactly what to do - they don't 
          go off and just try things out on their own.</p>

        <p>It's important to note that tutorials are not bad - when you're learning a new topic, you obviously need someone to 
          explain things and tell you exactly what to do, because you don't know it yourself yet. But you can still <em>engage</em> 
          with that tutorial rather than just passively go through it and then move on.</p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>

        <p>So I'm doing things differently this time around. OK, so I might still end up burning out anyway, but I've already 
          built this cool static blog site. And I'm following a roadmap that fully lays bare how little I know, how much I have 
          to learn, and how long it's going to take. But at least I'm going in with my eyes wide open this time.</p>
        
        <p>I've also consciously spent longer working through my HTML/CSS/JavaScript courses, because I'm actively building my own 
          projects around it to put my new knowledge immediately into practise. I'm trying not to rush things, even though I'm really 
          excited to reacquaint myself with C# when I get to some backend stuff!</p>

        <p>And as a final reflection: I have to make peace with the fact that I will most likely never make coding my job. But 
          I know that learning all this stuff is fun anyway, and that can be an end in itself. I'm not a failure if I don't become 
          an employed developer within an arbitrary period of time (or ever) - it's an almost certainty.</p>
          
        <p>And that's OK.</p>
