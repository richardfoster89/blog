        <h2>Git Good</h2>
        <h3>31 July 2024</h3>

        <p>So I decided to learn Git.</p>

        <p>I remember first reading about Git a few months ago and thinking, 'My god this sounds complicated.' I chalked it up
          to not being clever enough to understand it, and moved on with my life.</p>
        
        <p>Then two weeks ago I made some updates to my blog design and completely screwed things up. I had no kind of version control and 
          no idea how to get back to where I'd been pre-screw up, so I was left with no choice but to start all over again. Which was 
          neither a fun nor  effective use of time.</p>

        <p>Therefore, I started reading up on Git again. A quick DuckDuckGo (I avoid using anything Google if I can help it - on an unrelated note, 
          please don't check my HTML heads) brought up lots of promising results:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Hundreds of people asking the same question - <em>wtf is Git and why can't I understand it? P.S. wtf is Github and are they the same 
            thing?</em></li>
          <li>People saying things like, <em>'My first impression of Git was I guess this is simple enough, which quickly turned into Wow this is painful.'</em></li>
          <li>There's literally a website called <a href="https://ohshitgit.com/" target="_blank">Oh Shit, Git!?!</a> It begins as so: <em> 'Git is hard: screwing 
            up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is fucking impossible.' </em> Which I'm already learning is absolutely true, but it's 
            also not especially promising for a newbie to read (at least it's honest?)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Needless to say, I wasn't exactly enthused at the prospect of making a start with Git.</p>

        <p>But I managed to find a pretty good guide from <strong>freeCodeCamp</strong> called <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/guide-to-git-github-for-beginners-and-experienced-devs/" 
          target="_blank">How to Use Git and GitHub – a Guide for Beginners and Experienced Developers</a>, and this got me up and running fairly quickly (I will add that I 
          found lots of tutorials online, but most of them were not very clear).</p>

        <p>The good news is that I can now use Git! I'm aware that if I was ever able to get a dev job somewhere, I'd need to know more that this, but 
          I've basically established that I only really need to use a few simple commands to do what I want:</p>

        <code>
          <ul>
            <li>git init [projectName]</li>
            <li>git remote add origin [GithubRepoURL]</li>
            <li>git pull origin main</li>
            <li>code [fileName.extension]</li>
            <li>git status</li>
            <li>git add .</li>
            <li>git commit -m [message]</li>
            <li>git push origin main</li>
            </ul>
        </code>

        <p>And I must say, Git is actually really cool! Using some of the above commands, I can connect my local files to a 'remote repo' (i.e. one of my online 
          Github projects), push/pull from my online Github projects (i.e. send updated code/grab up to date code from Github). And it means I've got 
          version histories on Github so I can revert to previous changes if I mess something up.</p>

        <p>Git becomes even more powerful if you're part of a professional dev team: my understanding is that you can have multiple devs working on the 
          same code base at the same time, but they've each got their own local 'branch' of the code. They can all then 'push' their changes whenever 
          they're ready and all the separate changes will be merged with the main code base. Which is quite nifty.</p>

        <p>So I'm actually really glad I've now learnt the basics of Git (and Github), and I would encourage any other aspiring devs to do the same...</p>

        <p>...just don't feel stupid if you take a first glance and think it looks confusing. Because it is.</p>
