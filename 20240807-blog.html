        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <h3><time datetime="2024-08-07">7 August 2024</time></h3>

        <p>In my first ever blog entry (which you almost certainly won't have read), I mentioned how I've tried 
          teaching myself to code a few times, but alway dropped out or burnt out after a few months, even though 
          I  enjoyed myself throughout. I've spent a few weeks reflecting on this, and I think I've learnt a few 
          useful things about myself.</p>

        <p>Here are some of the mistakes I think I've made.</p>

        <h4>1. Not prioritising having fun</h4>

        <p>OK, so this might sound like a bit of a twee one to start with. But it kept cropping up when I was 
          self-reflecting: my primary motivation has always been to end up doing this as a career.</p>

        <p>I do tend to think of coding as a creative hobby, no different really to other creative pursuits like learning to 
          play an instrument or painting. I mean, we're making stuff out of nothing, aren't we? How many people start 
          learning to play the guitar with the sole aim of joining a band and becoming a professional musician? I'm not 
          talking about someone dreaming, 'Wow, wouldn't it be great if I was in a touring rock band' - I mean getting 
          famous being the only reason they practise.</p>

        <p>I produce my own electronic music <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rquitmusic" target="_blank">under the name 
          <strong>rquit</strong></a>. I enjoy it. I'm not too bad at it. And funnily enough, I've also burnt myself out 
          on this numerous times too. Why? Well, I followed the same trajectory as my previous coding burn-outs:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Start doing it for fun, and have loads of fun</li>
          <li>The thought crosses your mind, 'Imagine doing this for a living!'</li>
          <li>Immediately start trying to hit professional standards do it for a living</li>
          <li>Stop having fun</li>
          <li>Get disheartened and quit</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Maybe there are some people who can have these lofty ambitions and priorities and also still enjoy themselves. But 
          I am not one of those people. So I need a different motivation. If I can keep enjoying myself, keep learning, and 
          maybe take part in some community projects once I'm experienced enough, that's still time well spent.</p>

        <h4>2. Setting unrealistic goals</h4>

        <p>This one follows on quite nicely from that. The second I decide I want to start doing something to a professional 
          standard (which, I should state, is not a <em>bad thing</em> in and of itself), I draw up a silly, unrealistic 
          schedule which immediately adds unnecessary self-imposted pressure: <em>'If I work really hard and study for 3 hours a 
          day, I could probably get myself job-ready in six months.'</em></p>

        <p>This can cause burnout in a number of ways: it sucks the fun out of coding, because suddenly you're treating this fun 
          thing as more of a second job; you're setting yourself up for disappointment when you're still working your boring 
          office job after six months.</p>

        <p>For example, here's the beginner roadmap for a Full Stack Developer, taken from the excellent 
          <a href="https://roadmap.sh/full-stack" target="_blank">roadmap.sh</a>:</p>

        <div class="centredDiv">
          <img src="/assets/full-stack-roadmap.JPG" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>That's just the beginner pathway, by the way. It includes a number of languages, projects, concepts, etc. Now you 
          tell me - do you think that's only six month's worth of study?! I guess you could try and crank that out in 
          six months but good luck to you.</p>

        <div class="smallPrint">
          <p>(As a brief aside, it's really worth really highlighting for beginners that you can't just learn one language and then do 
            everything you want with it. When I first tried learning C#, I held the misconception that this one language was all 
            I needed. I remember finishing my C# fundamentals course (big shout out to 
            <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=bob+tabor&ia=web" target="_blank"> Bob Tabor</a>, you are <strong>the 
              man</strong>) and then thinking how I was ready to build my first android app. So I booted up Visual Studio and 
            was immediately hit by the realisation, <em>'Oh god I now have to learn a couple of other frameworks and markup 
            languages before I can even make a start?!')</em></p>
        </div>

        <p>Other than just pure mental burnout, unrealistic goals around timescales are also dangerous because you can easily 
          fall into the trap of rushing through learning just so you can tick off having 'completed' that language or that 
          project (the benefits of being an 'active learner' is covered in the next section). So you've got all this internal 
          pressure on yourself, and then as you're studying away, you realise you've not relly understood the things you've been 
          trying to learn anyway because you were rushing.</p>

        <h4>3. Being a passive learner</h4>

        <p>At least in my case, this mistake is a direct result of the first two mistakes.</p>

        <p>When you're determined to learn everything there is to learn in an unrealistically short space of time, you quickly 
          end up being a passive learner. This is where you read an article or follow a tutorial about a particular concept, 
          finish it and then think, 'OK cool, I know how that works now. On to the next topic.' You rush because you're 
          desperate to get onto the next topic.</p>

        <p>But it's when you become an <em>active learner</em> that you start to really understand topics. Reading the article, 
          following along with the examples provided, then trying to build your own examples to play around with what you've 
          just learnt - that's how you build understanding. When you look at the example code and think, 'I wonder what would 
          happen if I changed this thing? I bet I could break it,' or, 'That's given me a really good idea for a project I 
          could build - I'll make a note of that and have a go once I've finished up this lesson.'</p>

        <p>Passive learners get stuck in tutorial hell because they need someone to tell them exactly what to do, so they never 
          go off and just try things out on their own.</p>

        <p>It's important to note that tutorials are not bad - when you're learning a new topic, you obviously need someone to 
          explain things and tell you exactly what to do, because you don't know it yourself yet. But you can still <em>engage</em> 
          with that tutorial rather than just mindlessly skim it and then move on.</p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>

        <p>So I'm doing things differently this time around. OK, so I might still end up burning out anyway, but I've already 
          built this cool static blog site. And I'm following a roadmap that fully lays bare how little I know, how much I have 
          to learn, and how long it's going to take. But at least I'm going in with my eyes wide open this time.</p>
        
        <p>I've also consciously spent longer working through my HTML/CSS/JavaScript courses, because I'm actively doing my own 
          stuff around it and playing around with things as I learn them (even though I'm really excited to reacquaint myself with 
          C# when I get to some backend stuff!).</p>

        <p>And as a final reflection: I have to make peace with the fact that I will most likely never get to make this my job. But 
          I know that the process of learning is fun, and that can be an end in itself. It's not 'failure' if i'm not an employed 
          developer within an arbitrary period of time - it's an almost certainty.</p>
          
        <p>And that's OK.</p>
